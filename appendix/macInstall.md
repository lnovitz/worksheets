# Get Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a package manager that "installs the stuff you need that Apple (or your Linux system) didn't."

## Check if you have Homebrew

* Open the terminal
* Type `brew`

If you have homebrew you'll see this screen:

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
